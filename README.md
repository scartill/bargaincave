[![Manual Debug Build](https://github.com/scartill/bargaincave/actions/workflows/build_android_debug.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/scartill/bargaincave/actions/workflows/build_android_debug.yml)


## Dev Notes

* Run devenv.cmd to enable local testing (help yourself with Linux version)
* Use python 3.8 (or upgrade to corresponding AWS Lambda runtime version)
* Use DOSTA_BANKCARD_ID=cash to use cash (the only method accepted by `apitest`)
